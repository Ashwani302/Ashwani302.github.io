            <h2>1. Be mindful of running water.</h2>
            <p>Don't keep the faucet running the entire time you're brushing your teeth or washing your hands. Turn it off while scrubbing and turn it back on when you're ready to rinse. Also, avoid luxuriously long showers. Try to limit shower time to 10 to 15 minutes to prevent wasting excess gallons of water.</p>

        <section class="step">
            <h2>2. Fix leaks as soon as possible.</h2>
            <p>Look out for leaky faucets, dripping water from shower heads, rusting pipes, and signs of water damage. Locate the source of the leak, and fix it immediately to avoid wasting more water.</p>

        <section class="step">
            <h2>3. Don't let the toilet run.</h2>
            <p>If you notice that your toilet is constantly running, try replacing the flapper. Shut off the water to the toilet, flush to drain the tank, unhook the old flapper, and replace it with a new one. If that doesn't work, it may be time to buy a new toilet.</p>

        <section class="step">
            <h2>4. Wash full loads only.</h2>
            <p>Make sure the dishwasher and washing machine are full before running them. Use energy-saving settings for light washes and smaller loads. Consider investing in water-saving models when purchasing new appliances.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="step">
            <h2>5. Use a compost bin.</h2>
            <p>An in-sink garbage disposal uses a lot of water. Instead, use a compost bin, which is healthier for the environment and reduces water waste.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="step">
            <h2>6. Insulate pipes.</h2>
            <p>Insulate exposed pipes around the house, especially in the attic and basement. This reduces the time water needs to run to heat up. Additionally, cover the water heater with an insulating blanket to further speed up the process.</p>

        <section class="step">
            <h2>7. Run the sprinklers in the morning.</h2>
            <p>Water your lawn in the early morning to prevent rapid evaporation. Position sprinklers to water grass and landscaping appropriately, avoiding waste by spraying sidewalks or the side of the house.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="step">
            <h2>8. Perform routine appliance maintenance.</h2>
            <p>Regular maintenance of appliances prevents leaks and improves energy efficiency. Look for water-efficient fixtures and appliances to reduce water usage by about 20%.</p>

            <h2>How to actually conserve water?</h2>
            <p>In rural areas, people may not understand technical terms in water conservation. Our system helps by showing how much water to save based on usage. For example, using 500 liters a day means saving around 100 liters. This system provides clear guidance, especially in rural areas.</p>
