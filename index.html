                We all know water is essential, but too many of us think it’s unlimited.<br><br>
                In reality, fresh water is a finite resource that is rapidly becoming scarce.<br><br>
                In India, a warming climate is drying up lakes and rivers, while rapid urbanization and water pollution
                are putting enormous pressure on the quantity and quality of surface and ground water.<br><br>
                The country’s fragile agricultural system still depends primarily on rainfall and a bad monsoon season
                can wreak havoc on the national economy.<br><br>
                Water conservation is a key element of any strategy that aims to alleviate the water scarcity crisis in
                India.<br><br>

            <h2>What does Water Conservation mean?</h2>
            <p>
                Water conservation refers to the preservation, control, and development of water resources, both surface
                and groundwater, and the prevention of pollution.<br><br>
                Water conservation is the practice of using water efficiently to reduce unnecessary water usage.<br><br>
                According to Fresh Water Watch, water conservation is important because fresh, clean water is a limited
                resource, as well as a costly one.<br><br>
